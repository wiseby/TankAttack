## Tank Attack

The curiosity in game-development inspired me to build this game.

It's written in C# with the popular GameEngine/Framework named MonoGame.

The idea is a fast topdown vehicle blasting, multiplayer (classic sharing of keyboard and screen) shooter.
Picking up power-ups for superiour advantage and quick turn-arounds in gameplay. It should be easy and fun to play with your friend when you have a minute or two to spare!

Textures should be replaced with lower res sprites to be more oldschool and retrofit. This projects aim is to get a bigger understanding on 2D game making.

I got to keep working on this baby!
